              <p class="black-color font-size-20 mb-20 mobile-equal-padding">
                We wrote a detailed post about the best tourist attractions in Albania from a local’s perspective, focusing on the lively capital, <b><em>Tirana</em></b>. 
                Keep an eye out for Part 2, where we’ll likely explore the beautiful <b></em>coastal cities</em></b>.
                This city, rich in history and culture, serves as the ideal starting point for your journey through Albania’s hidden gems and must-see landmarks. 
                The guide delves into itenerary, hidden gems, stays, dining, etc.
                <br><br>
                At the heart of Tirana, a vibrant triangle connects Skanderbeg Square, the Castle of Tirana, and the New Bazaar. 
                These landmarks represent the city's rich cultural heritage and modern charm, offering a mix of history, local dining, and market life. Together, these attractions represent some of the best of Tirana’s tourist attractions, offering a mix of history, dining, and local life all within a short walking distance.
                <br><br>
                Another highlight is Blloku, once an exclusive area reserved for communist leaders, now transformed into a lively nightlife district full of trendy bars, lounges, and restaurants. Dajti Mountain, just outside the city, offers a peaceful escape into nature with activities like horse riding and incredible panoramic views from the Dajti Ekspres cable car.
                <br><br>
                Whether you're seeking a relaxed stroll through the New Bazaar or an adventurous day on Dajti Mountain, Tirana has something for every traveler. These attractions, alongside cultural landmarks like Reja and the newly revitalized Pyramid, make it clear why Tirana stands out as one of the Best Tourist Attractions in Albania.
                <br><br> 
                Let's get started.
              </p>

                    <h2>First Stop: Castle of Tirana</h2>
                    <img loading="lazy" src="assets/img/blog/kalaja-e-tiranes0.jpg" class="mobile-emerald-card-pic" alt="Castle of Tirana - Best Tourist Attractions in Albania"/>
                    <p class="font-size-18 black-color">
                      <br>
                      The first stop on your journey is Tirana's Castle, known locally as "Kalaja e Tiranës." This historical site, which dates back to the Byzantine period, has been revitalized in recent years. Inside the castle walls, you'll find a charming blend of old and new, as the area has been thoughtfully renovated to house a variety of restaurants, cozy cafés, souvenir shops, and traditional tapestry stores. It has become a vibrant hub for both locals and tourists, offering a taste of Albania’s rich cultural heritage.
                      <br><br>
                      As you stroll through the grounds, keep an eye out for historic touches like a horse-drawn carriage and an old cannon, and murals which help preserve the feeling of stepping back in time. The blend of the old-world ambiance with modern comforts makes Kalaja e Tiranës a perfect start to your exploration of tourist attractions in Albania.
                      <br><br>
                      Bonus tip for parking: If you're driving, parking can be conveniently found at the nearby Toptani Shopping Center, 10 steps away from the castle. Alternatively, you can park at the New Bazaar, located only two minutes away, which will one of the following stops. While there are some free parking options (marked with signs featuring a blue background and a white "P"), they can be hard to come by. Even locals often struggle to find free spots, so consider yourself lucky if you find one!
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li style="--i: 2">
                    <h2>Skanderbeg Square</h2>
                    <img loading="lazy" src="assets/img/blog/skanderbeg-square.jpg" class="mobile-emerald-card-pic" alt="Skanderbeg Square - Best Tourist Attractions in Albania"/>
                    <p class="font-size-18 black-color">
                      <br>
                      Our second stop is Skanderbeg Square, or "Sheshi Skënderbej" as it’s known locally, the beating heart of Tirana and a focal point for both locals and tourists. The square is named after Albania’s national hero, Gjergj Kastrioti, a 15th-century military leader who led the resistance against the Ottoman Empire. 
                      The centerpiece of the square is an impressive statue of Skanderbeg on horseback, symbolizing his role in Albania’s fight for independence. 
                      <br></br>
                      Surrounding the square are several landmarks worth visiting. The Et'hem Bey Mosque, with its intricate frescoes, and the Sahati Clocktower, which offers panoramic views of the city from the top, are both open to visitors and provide a glimpse into the city's rich heritage. 
                      <br></br>
                      Also bordering the square is the Opera & Ballet Theatre, where you can relax at one of the many cafés outside and take in the lively atmosphere. 
                      If you time your visit right, you might catch a festival or concert. Skanderbeg Square frequently hosts events, including markets, mobile amusement parks, and celebrations during Christmas, New Year’s, Albania’s Independence Day and White Night (28-29 November). 
                      <br></br>
                      During summer, spontaneous outdoor concerts are often held in both Skanderbeg Square and Mother Teresa Square, a 10-minute walk away down the boulevard. 
                      While you can check the <a class="my-link-style" target="_blank" href="https://tirana.al" rel="nofollow">Municipality of Tirana’s website</a> for event updates, keep in mind that the calendar is not always regularly updated.
                      <br></br>         
                      Another feature of the square is the National History Museum's stunning mosaic, which immediately greets visitors with a powerful depiction of Albania’s struggle for independence. The museum itself offers a fascinating dive into Albania’s history, though it’s worth noting that, as of 2023, only one of the three floors provides English translations for the exhibits. There is a small entrance fee, but it’s a valuable stop for those wanting to learn more about Albania's past.
                      <br></br>     
                      Skanderbeg Square is only a 5 minute walk from the previous stop, Castle of Tirana.

                    <h2>New Bazaar</h2>
                    <img loading="lazy" src="assets/img/blog/new-bazaar.jpg" class="mobile-emerald-card-pic" alt="New Bazaar - Best Tourist Attractions in Albania"/>
                    <p class="font-size-18 black-color">
                      <br>
                      One of the highlights of Tirana’s vibrant New Bazaar, or "Pazari i Ri," is its wide variety of local dining options, including hidden gems like Te Meti and popular favorites such as Oda restaurant. 
                      The New Bazaar itself is a bustling hub of activity, known for its picturesque stalls filled with fresh produce, artisan goods, and souvenir shops offering handcrafted items and local specialties. 
                      With its colorful surroundings and lively atmosphere, it has become a prime destination among the best tourist attractions in Albania, blending modern renovations with traditional Albanian charm.
                      <br><br>
                      If you're feeling brave, look for "Rakia" in one of the stalls or restaurants, a local 40 proof alcohol made of grape. Just keep in mind that it has a strong kick to it!
                      <br><br>
                      If you're looking for an authentic culinary experience, Te Meti is a must-visit. This tiny spot, squeezed between two Nur restaurants, offers some of the best "qofte" in Tirana. These savory, cylindrical meatballs made of minced veal and herbs pair perfectly with tzatziki, fresh bread, and a cold beer. There’s no waiter service here, just walk up to the grill and order directly, adding to the rustic charm of the experience. Despite its lack of signage, the flavor of Te Meti’s qofte is unmatched, making it a local favorite.
                      <br><br>
                      For a more atmospheric dining experience, Oda restaurant offers a delightful combination of traditional Albanian cuisine and live performances of calming ballads and folk music. The restaurant’s interior is beautifully designed in an old, traditional style, with wooden furniture and Albanian decor creating an inviting ambiance. Popular among both locals and tourists, Oda’s lively yet cozy atmosphere makes it the perfect place to enjoy an authentic meal while immersing yourself in Albania’s rich musical heritage.
                      <br><br>
                      Tip - These three attractions, Skanderbeg Square, Castle of Tirana, and New Bazaar form a neat triangle, each only about a 3-4 minute walk from one another. This makes them ideal for tourists who want to maximize their visit without spending too much time on travel. You can easily cover all three locations in a morning or afternoon stroll, stopping along the way for food, shopping, and plenty of sightseeing.

                      The Pyramid of Tirana is one of the city’s most unique landmarks, offering panoramic views and making it a great spot for photos, especially at sunset. Originally built in 1988 as a museum dedicated to Albania’s former communist leader, Enver Hoxha, the structure now serves a new purpose after its recent renovation. Today, it's home to cozy cafés, restaurants, and creative spaces, transforming it from a symbol of the past into a hub of modern culture and leisure. Its surrounding area is a great place to relax, explore, and experience a blend of old and (mostly) new Tirana.
                      <br><br>
                      Conveniently located just five minutes from the Castle of Tirana, the pyramid is easy to spot as you exit the castle area, making it an effortless addition to your itinerary.
                      <br><br>
                      Fun fact: Before the renovation, the pyramid’s sides were of smooth and slippery tiling, without the staircases now seen on its exterior. In those days, daring local kids would often attempt to climb the steep sides using shoes with good grip!

                    <h2>Blloku</h2>

                    <p class="font-size-18 black-color">
                      <br>
                      Blloku ("The Block" in English) is Tirana’s premier district for nightlife, known for its lively atmosphere, packed with trendy lounges, bars and restaurants.
                      Once an exclusive area restricted to communist political leaders during the rule of Enver Hoxha, Blloku was off-limits to the general public. 
                      Today, it has transformed into one of the most vibrant and stylish parts of the city, having a reputation as one of the more upscale areas in Tirana.
                      <br><br>
                      Whether you’re looking to enjoy a casual drink with friends, dance the night away, or experience a more luxurious evening, there are plenty of venues to choose from. The area is a favorite among locals and visitors alike for evening outings, and the best time to experience Blloku is, without a doubt, at night. The streets come alive with music, conversation, and the twinkling lights of modern venues, contrasting the area’s once-restricted nature.
                      <br><br>
                      For those seeking panoramic views, Sky Tower’s rooftop bar is a must-visit. As the highest vantage point in Blloku, it provides sweeping views of the city below, coupled with fancy service and an upscale atmosphere. It’s a great place to start your evening or enjoy a quiet drink while taking in the beauty of Tirana at night.
                      <br><br>
                      Blloku’s reputation as an exclusive area during the communist regime has left a lasting mark, and it remains one of the fanciest, most upscale districts in the city. You’ll notice this in the attention to detail in the design and interior of the many bars and restaurants. Nearly every venue in Blloku has invested in creating a unique, luxurious atmosphere. From sleek modern lounges to vintage-inspired cocktail bars, the options are as diverse as they are impressive.

                    <h2>Noteworthy Attractions</h2>
                    <img loading="lazy" src="assets/img/blog/reja.jpg" class="mobile-emerald-card-pic" alt="Reja 'The Cloud' - Best Tourist Attractions in Albania"/>

                    <p class="font-size-18 black-color">
                    <br>
                      Reja (meaning "The Cloud" in English) is a stunning art installation created by the renowned Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto. Located between Skanderbeg Square and the path to the Castle of Tirana, this unique structure has become a must-see attraction for both locals and visitors alike. 
                      <br><br>
                      Made entirely of white steel rods, it resembles a floating, cloud-like form, inviting people to interact with it. The open design allows visitors to view the sky and cityscape while sitting inside. The installation is particularly photogenic, making it a favorite among tourists who want to capture creative selfies or snapshots.
                      <br><br>
                      Pro tip: If you spot any of the glass seats that placed within the installation, don't hesitate to climb and claim your spot!

                    <br><br>
                    <p style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: 700; color: #000;">2. Dajti Mountain</p>
                    <p class="font-size-18 black-color">
                    <br>
                    Dajti Mountain, located on the outskirts of Tirana, is a must-visit destination year-round for those looking to escape the bustle of the city and immerse themselves in nature. 
                    The mountain offers spectacular views, wildlife, outdoor activities, and delicious local food, making it a popular spot for both tourists and locals alike.
                    <br><br>
                    A nice way to reach Dajti National Park is via the Dajti Ekspres, a funicular cable car that takes you up the mountain. The ride offers breathtaking panoramic views of Tirana and its surroundings. 
                    The trip takes about 15 minutes one way and is a scenic experience in itself. Once at the top, you’ll be greeted by crisp mountain air and views that stretch as far as the Adriatic Sea on clear days.
                    <br><br>
                    Funicular Pricing (as of 2024): The round trip costs around 1000 ALL (about €10) for adults and 500 ALL (about €5) for children. It’s best to check for updated prices at the station or at <a class="my-link-style" target="_blank" href="https://dajtiekspres.com/" rel="nofollow">Dajti Ekspres Website</a> before planning your trip.
                    <br><br>
                    Dajti is rich in wildlife and offers various activities. A few of them are Mini Golf, Adventure Park (for kids), Mini-shooting games with BB guns and horse riding (or more aptly, horse walking).
                    You'll find msot of these activities at the end of the cable car trip.
                    <br><br>
                    For those driving to the mountain, the journey is equally picturesque, with plenty of places to stop and enjoy traditional food along the way. 
                    Restaurants like Gurra e Perrisë (translated as "Spring of the Beauty") offer a unique dining experience, serving fresh fish caught from outdoor tanks of the restaurant, as well as local delicacies like rabbit, pheasant, and other traditional Albanian dishes. 
                    These establishments are perfect for enjoying a hearty meal while surrounded by the tranquility of the mountain landscape.
                    <br><br>    
                    As you descend the mountain, you’ll often see locals filling their jugs with fresh, drinkable water from mountain streams. 
                    <br><b>Tip:</b> This is because tap water in Albania is not drinkable, and locals load up their trunks with drinkable water during the weekends, which lasts them for a week or two.
